#Ai-Aimbot with visuals

Run the detections.py to start it, might take ~5 seconds until the visuals appear. The code is commented, so make changes as you wish. The visual detection is based on the yolov8_live_overlay from https://github.com/RootKit-Org/AI-Aimbot/tree/main/customScripts/yolov8_live_overlay.
